# Causal-SpatioTemporal Graph Scheduler (C-STGS)

C-STGS is a differentiable and explainable framework for optimizing EV-charging schedules under grid constraints. It integrates spatio-temporal graph modeling, causal feature attribution, and differentiable optimization to jointly minimize power loss and enhance grid stability using public EV-charging datasets.

## 🚀 Overview
The growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) increases stress on distribution grids through clustered charging demand. **C-STGS** addresses this by learning adaptive, explainable charging schedules that balance grid stability and power efficiency.
